# Derivative-free-attack
Code for TDSC'21 paper 'Taking Care of The Discretization Problem: A Comprehensive Study of the Discretization Problem and A Black-Box Adversarial Attack in Discrete Integer Domain'.

We implement our classification DFA based on the framework of [RACOS](https://github.com/eyounx/RACOS), for which we implement our new algorithm and manage to engineer to significantly improve its efficiency and scalability with lots of domain-specific optimizations.

Code will be available soon.
